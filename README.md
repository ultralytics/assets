# 🌟 Welcome to the Ultralytics Assets Repository

Welcome! You've arrived at the [Ultralytics](https://www.ultralytics.com/) Assets repository, your central hub for visual assets, powerful pre-trained models, and curated datasets. These resources are designed to complement the Ultralytics YOLO ecosystem, supporting tasks like [object detection](https://docs.ultralytics.com/tasks/detect/), [instance segmentation](https://docs.ultralytics.com/tasks/segment/), [image classification](https://docs.ultralytics.com/tasks/classify/), [pose estimation](https://docs.ultralytics.com/tasks/pose/), and [object tracking](https://docs.ultralytics.com/modes/track/).

## 💡 Getting Started with Usage

### 📥 Download Pretrained Models Seamlessly

Ultralytics YOLO frameworks automatically download required pre-trained models from this repository if they are not found locally.

```python
from ultralytics import YOLO

# Load a pre-trained Ultralytics YOLO model
model = YOLO("yolo26n.pt")  # Model automatically downloaded if not present

# Define the source image path
source = "path/to/image.jpg"

# Perform inference
results = model(source)  # Returns detection results
```

### 🌐 Embrace the Visuals

All visual assets are available on the main branch and can be downloaded directly for your projects, presentations, or documentation needs.

### 📚 Explore Our Datasets

Our datasets are accessible through repository releases. Each dataset includes a README file with usage instructions. Please review the specific licenses and guidelines for each dataset to ensure compliance with your project requirements.
