# 🌟 Welcome to the Ultralytics Assets Repository

Welcome! You've arrived at the [Ultralytics](https://ultralytics.com) Assets repository, your one-stop hub for visual assets, powerful pre-trained models, and carefully curated datasets. These tools are meticulously crafted to complement the Ultralytics YOLO ecosystem, providing capabilities that span object detection, instance segmentation, image classification, pose estimation, and tracking.

[![Ultralytics Actions](https://github.com/ultralytics/assets/actions/workflows/format.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ultralytics/assets/actions/workflows/format.yml) <a href="https://ultralytics.com/discord"><img alt="Discord" src="https://img.shields.io/discord/1089800235347353640?logo=discord&logoColor=white&label=Discord&color=blue"></a>

## 🛠 Features at a Glance

- **🖼 Visual Assets**: Dive into our collection of banners and logos that you can incorporate into your applications or as part of your collaboration with Ultralytics tools.
- **🤖 Models at Your Fingertips**: Tap into the power of pre-trained models, fine-tuned and ready to deploy. These models are optimized to tackle a wide range of computer vision tasks with ease and precision.
- **📦 Datasets Ready for Action**: Enhance your machine learning projects with our repositories of annotated data, primed for model training, validation, and beyond.

## 💡 Getting Started with Usage

### 📥 Download Pretrained Models Seamlessly

Ultralytics YOLO frameworks are engineered for convenience—missing a pre-trained model? It will be automatically fetched from this very repository.

_For example:_

```python
from ultralytics import YOLO

# Instantiating a pre-trained YOLOv8n model
model = YOLO("yolov8n.pt")

# Path to your image
source = "path/to/image.jpg"

# Perform inference with just one line
results = model(source)  # This command completes the inference cycle and returns detection results
```

### 🌐 Embrace the Visuals

All our visual assets are at your fingertips, downloadable straight from the main branch for your projects, presentations, or documentation.

### 📚 Explore Our Datasets

Our datasets are accessible via repository releases and come with comprehensive READMEs to guide you through the process. Make sure to review the licenses and specific guidance for each dataset to align with your project needs.
