# Ultralytics Assets Repository

## Overview

Welcome to the Ultralytics Assets repository! This repository serves as a storage for visual assets like banners, logos, and more importantly, pre-trained models and datasets. These assets are designed to work seamlessly with Ultralytics YOLO implementations, aiding in object detection, instance segmentation, image classification, pose estimation, and multi-object tracking.

## Features

1. **Visual Assets**: Banners and logos to use in your projects or for showcasing your use of Ultralytics resources.
2. **Models**: Pre-trained models that are ready for download and immediate use. These models are optimized for various computer vision tasks.
3. **Datasets**: Collections of annotated data that can be used for training or validating models.

## Usage

### Autodownload of Pretrained Models

When using Ultralytics YOLO APIs, if a pre-trained model is not found locally, it will be automatically downloaded from this repository.

Here's a simple example using Python:

```python
from ultralytics import YOLO

# Load a pretrained YOLOv8n model
model = YOLO('yolov8n.pt')

# Define path to the image file
source = 'path/to/image.jpg'

# Run inference on the source
results = model(source)  # Returns a list of Results objects
```

### Accessing Visual Assets

The visual assets can be downloaded directly from the main branch of this repository. They are free for use in your own projects or documentation.

### Accessing Datasets

Datasets can be downloaded from the repository releases. Please refer to the individual dataset READMEs for usage instructions and licenses.

## Contributing

If you'd like to contribute models, datasets, or visual assets to this repository, please submit a pull request or open an issue to discuss the contribution.

## Support

For any questions, feature requests, or debugging queries, feel free to reach out to the Ultralytics support team or raise an issue on GitHub.
